## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

- All screens share a unified layout (`app-frame`, `app-container`) for visual consistency.
- Form validation is handled manually using React state.
- Data is passed between pages using `useNavigate` and `location.state`.
- No backend integration—this is a frontend-only prototype.
